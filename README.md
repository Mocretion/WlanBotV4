# WlanBot
Not the best but does its job pretty well. If someone tries to you this you will need to add your Discord token in Program.cs. You also might want to change the Lavalink credentials.
If this bot does not work for you you might need to update Lavalink or check their Issues page for issues you might encounter (see console log). Lavalink V4 is necessary!
# How to use
Create a new Discord channel and type PINEAPPLE in chat. This is your music channel now.
