# How to use
1. Add your Discord token in Porgram.cs
2. Change Lavalink credentials (Your Lavalink Server must be of version 4)
3. Create a file in the same folder as your bots executable called servers.json
4. Start the bot
5. Create a new Discord text channel and type PINEAPPLE in chat. This is now a channel dedicated to music and the bot

# Notice
Not the best but does its job pretty well. If this bot does not work for you you might need to update Lavalink or check their Issues page for issues you might encounter (see console log). Lavalink V4 is necessary!
